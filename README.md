## Using

-   Open an existing file with a `.es` file extenion or open a new text file (`ctrl+n`) and change the language mode to `Elasticsearch (es)` by pressing `ctrl+k,m` and select `es`. Elasticsearch queries and funtionalities are enabled in the es language mode in Visual Studio Code editor.
-   For https endpoints, just add protocol type in url : `https://host`
-   For auth protected clusters, you can use `http://user:pass@host:9200` as the endpoint url to have it auth.
